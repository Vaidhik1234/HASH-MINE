## ✦ What is EQM?

Equium ($EQM) is a fair-launched token on Solana that you mine — like Bitcoin, but with a CPU and a wallet.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Total supply** | 21,000,000 EQM (forever capped) |
| **Mineable** | 18,900,000 EQM (90%) |
| **Block reward** | 25 EQM, halving every ~8.6 months |
| **Block time** | ~1 minute |
| **PoW** | Equihash (96, 5) — runs on any CPU |
| **Network** | Solana (devnet today, mainnet soon) |

No VC allocation. No insider tokens. Every coin in circulation either came from the 10% premine (DEX liquidity + project treasury) or was mined block-by-block by someone running this code.

## ✦ How does mining work?

Your computer guesses random numbers (`nonce`s) until it finds one that, combined with the current network challenge, hashes to a number small enough to win the block. The first valid solution submitted to the chain in each ~1-minute round earns 25 EQM.

The puzzle is **memory-bound, not compute-bound** — that's the point. Equihash is designed so a $40,000 GPU rig isn't meaningfully faster than your laptop. CPUs win.

A few things worth knowing:

- **Solutions are bound to your wallet.** The puzzle includes your public key, so a copyist who tries to front-run your broadcast solution must re-solve from scratch under their own wallet. You don't get sniped.
- **Difficulty auto-adjusts.** Every 60 blocks the network retargets so blocks keep landing roughly every minute, regardless of how many people are mining.
- **Rewards halve over time.** Initial 25 EQM/block → 12.5 → 6.25 → … forever. Mirrors Bitcoin's emission curve.
- **Empty rounds are possible.** If nobody mines a given round, the reward stays in the program-owned vault permanently. Real fixed supply, no IOUs.

## ✦ Mine in your browser

The easiest way to start: open [the web miner](#) in any modern browser, connect Phantom or Solflare, click **Start Mining**. Everything happens client-side in a Web Worker — your wallet never leaves your device.

> _Hosted miner link goes here once we deploy the frontend._

If you want to run the web miner locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HannaPrints/equium.git
cd equium/clients/web-miner/app
npm install
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:5173
```

The browser miner works on phones too — Equihash (96, 5) only needs ~50 MB of RAM, well within mobile WASM limits.

## ✦ Run the CLI miner

For dedicated mining (longer sessions, multiple cores eventually), use the Rust binary. It's faster than the browser solver and prints live stats.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HannaPrints/equium.git
cd equium
cargo build -p equium-cli-miner --release

./target/release/equium-miner \
  --rpc-url https://api.devnet.solana.com \
  --keypair ~/.config/solana/id.json
```

Your wallet needs a small amount of SOL for transaction fees (under 0.001 SOL per block). Mined EQM lands in your wallet's associated token account automatically.

```
$ equium-miner --rpc-url https://api.devnet.solana.com --keypair my-wallet.json

The mint address is intentionally not listed here pre-mainnet. The miner reads it from the on-chain program config when you connect, so you don't need to know it yourself.

## ✦ FAQ

**Will I make money mining EQM?** Maybe. Maybe not. Don't quit your job. Treat this like distributed sudoku that occasionally gives you internet money.

**What if my computer is slow?** It mines slower. The network adjusts difficulty so blocks come at the same rate regardless of total hashrate, but your *share* of those blocks scales with your CPU. A laptop will still earn — just less than a workstation.

**Can someone steal my work?** No. Solutions are cryptographically bound to the wallet that signs the transaction. If you broadcast a winning solution and someone copies the bytes, the chain rejects their tx because the puzzle includes their wallet address, not yours.

**Why Solana?** Cheap fees. A `mine` transaction costs a fraction of a cent. The same protocol on Ethereum mainnet would cost more in gas than the block reward is worth.

**Is the supply really capped at 21M?** Yes. The mint authority will be revoked before mainnet — at the SPL Token level, no more EQM can ever be created.
